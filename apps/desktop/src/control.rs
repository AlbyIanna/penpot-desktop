//! N5 — the vault switch mechanism and its headless control surface.
//!
//! [`VaultRunner`] owns the live [`RunningApp`] and turns "open a different
//! vault" into the exact M2 operation, pointed at a new tree:
//!
//! 1. write the switch marker (crash safety) BEFORE anything is wiped;
//! 2. stop the current stack cleanly ([`RunningApp::shutdown`] — sync daemon,
//!    index, proxy, supervised postgres/valkey/JVM all go down);
//! 3. wipe the disposable Penpot DB cluster + the vault index
//!    ([`crate::vault::reset_disposable_state`]) — zero residue of the old
//!    vault before the new one reconciles (invariant 2, P0);
//! 4. point the registry's active vault at the new root;
//! 5. [`boot`] the target: re-provision the single user, reconcile from the
//!    new tree (each file re-imported under its ORIGINAL id via the manifest),
//!    rebuild the per-vault index, re-render thumbnails;
//! 6. clear the switch marker.
//!
//! A SIGKILL anywhere in 1–6 leaves the marker on disk; the next boot's
//! [`boot_active_vault`] sees it and completes the switch forward to the
//! target (never a half-switched hybrid). Because the wipe (step 3) always
//! precedes the reconcile (step 5), forward-completion is safe from any
//! interruption point: the previous vault's DB state is gone first.
//!
//! [`serve_control`] exposes this over a localhost-only HTTP port
//! (`PENPOT_LOCAL_CONTROL_PORT`) so the N5 gate can drive switches WITHOUT the
//! GUI dialog. It is a test/automation affordance: the GUI's File > Open Vault
//! calls [`VaultRunner::switch_to`] directly, no HTTP involved.
//!
//! D4 adds [`VaultRunner::reboot_in_place`] — the same stop→boot dance
//! ([`VaultRunner::stop_then_boot`], factored out so the two operations never
//! drift into two copies of the boot sequence) run against the SAME vault, to
//! apply preferences that are baked in at boot (plugins/CSP live in
//! `config.js`, read once at script load; the supervisor cannot hot-add the
//! exporter child). The one fact that must differ between the two callers —
//! whether the disposable DB/index gets wiped — is pulled out into the pure
//! [`wipes_disposable_state`], and whether the crash marker gets written into
//! [`writes_switch_marker`], so both decisions are unit-testable without
//! booting a stack. See their doc comments for the reasoning.
